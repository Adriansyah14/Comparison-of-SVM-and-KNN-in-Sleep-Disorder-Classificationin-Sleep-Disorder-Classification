# Comparison-of-SVM-and-KNN-in-Sleep-Disorder-Classificationin-Sleep-Disorder-Classification

This project is research that I did for my Final Project or Thesis. As the title suggests, this study uses the Support Vector Machine (SVM) and K-Nearest Neighbor (KNN) methods for classifying sleep disorders.

The SVM method utilizes the Radial Basis Function (RBF) kernel. Hyperparameter tuning is carried out in this RBF kernel using GridSearchCV.

The KNN method searches for the K value which is a variable for the number of nearest neighbors. Determination of the K value is carried out using the K-Fold CV method to ensure the K value is not too large or too small.
